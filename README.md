# Scene Cut Detection in Videos
This project is part of the Image Processing course exercises, concentrating on detecting scene cuts within videos through histogram analysis. The goal is to analyze videos to identify transitions between two distinct scenes. This repository contains the implementation for this exercise, following the guidelines and tasks as outlined in the course material.


# Methodology
The algorithm leverages histogram analysis to detect scene changes in videos. It first converts frames into grayscale to simplify the analysis, then examines the histogram of each frame to identify significant changes indicative of scene transitions. The methodology, including specific adjustments for different video categories, is elaborated in the report accompanying this code.
