## Overview

Each directory in this repository corresponds to a specific exercise or project undertaken during the course. These exercises cover a wide range of topics within image processing, including but not limited to sampling, histograms, image enhancement, restoration, convolution, Fourier transforms, image compression, and advanced techniques like image blending and GAN inversions.

## Contents

- `ex1/`: Scene cut detection in videos.
- `ex2/`: Audio denoising with histogram analysis.
- `ex3/`: Image blending and creation of hybrid images.
- `ex4/`: High-resolution image blending into low-resolution images.
- `ex5/`: Deep learning-based image reconstruction using StyleGAN2.

Each directory includes:

- `requirements.txt` file listing necessary dependencies
- A detailed report in PDF format outlining the approach, algorithm, results, and insights
- Additional resources such as images, audio files, and Colab notebooks as applicable


## Getting Started
